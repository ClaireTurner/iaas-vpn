# PPTP VPN FAQ

## Why am I unable to add additional users for PPTP VPN?

PPTP VPN is available on all accounts, but is initially configured to enable access for one user at a time. To request an account to be enabled for unlimited PPTP at no additional charge, please create a ticket through the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) with the following information, along with any additional details that may be desired:

* Topic: PPTP VPN Request
* Text: I currently have PPTP limited to one user at a time. Please enable unlimited PPTP VPN access for my account.

An IBM support team member will update the account to enable unlimited PPTP access, which is available at no additional charge. The ticket will be updated if any additional information is required.

## What are the available categories for a user's status within the Customer Portal?

Customer status categories include those that are able to be updated by a user and those that may appear automatically. They include:

* **Active** - The user has access to the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) and VPN based on permissions set by the account administrator. This status may be manually selected and/or changed at any time.
* **Disabled** - The user does not have access to any permissions or subscriptions on the account, including [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) and VPN. If set to disabled by another user on the account, this status may be manually selected and/or changed at any time.
* **VPN Only** - The user only has access to VPN connectivity and may not access the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/). This status may be manually selected and/or changed at any time.
* **Inactive** - The user has not utilized the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) or VPN in the last 60 days. This is a system-generated status.
* **cancel_pending** - An administrator on the account has canceled this user and the cancellation is currently being processed. This is a system-generated status.
