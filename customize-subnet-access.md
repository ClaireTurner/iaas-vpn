# Customize subnet access

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} allows customers to set up VPN access from user accounts to specific private subnets. This setup must be performed by a user with VPN Administration access, such as a local system administrator.

To customize subnet access, navigate to the VPN interface and follow these steps:
1. Select the **Manual** radio button in the **Subnets** column.
* Select the **Edit** link in the **Manual Overrides** column.
* Select or deselect the desired checkboxes in the **Grant Access** column of the desired subnets for which you wish to update accessibility.
* Select the **Save** link to apply the changes. Or, select the **Cancel** link to return to the previous screen without saving your changes.
