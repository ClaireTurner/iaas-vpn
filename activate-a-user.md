# Activate or Deactivate SSL VPN Access for a User

SSL VPN enables a user to create a secure tunnel from a remote desktop to the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} private network, using a standard web browser. The {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} SSL VPN is compatible with Java-capable web browsers, and the SSL VPN service is provided free to all users. Activate or deactivate SSL VPN access for a user with these steps:

1. Navigate to the VPN interface on the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/).
* Select the **SSL Access** checkbox next to the desired username to activate or deactivate SSL VPN access for that user.

**Note:** SSL access must be activated before a user can connect using SSL.
